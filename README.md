# IP API
This is the most basic IP API that can be made with node.js

Its usage in the client-side:

The info it returns depending on the path:

"/text" -> get the ip address as text
"/json" -> get the ip address as json
"/json/<variable>" -> get a json(an object), which has the ip address as a string inside it, named as <variable>
  
  check usage.js for more usage in vanilla javascript.
